# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to perform **customer segmentation**, enabling the business to understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies effectively.

## Features

- **Customer Segmentation**:
  - Groups customers based on their purchase behavior.
- **Cluster Visualization**:
  - Visualizes customer groups in 2D/3D space for insights.
- **Scalable Algorithm**:
  - Works with datasets of various sizes and dimensions.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas: For data manipulation.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.
  - scikit-learn: For clustering and evaluation.
  - matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
  - plotly (optional): For interactive cluster plots.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore advanced clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
- Add a web interface for clustering insights.
- Integrate demographic data (e.g., age, location) for richer segmentation.
